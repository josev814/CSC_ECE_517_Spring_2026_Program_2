Volunteer Management System
The Volunteer Management System is a web-based application designed to help organizations manage volunteers for events or initiatives. The system allows volunteers to register, sign up for events, be assigned to events, and track volunteering hours. The emphasis of the system is on core functionality rather than user interface design.
